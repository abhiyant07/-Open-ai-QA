EXLSERVICE HOLDINGS, INC.
Reconciliation of Adjusted Financial Measures to GAAP Measures
In addition to its reported operating results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), EXL has included in this release
certain financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures, including the following:
 
(i)
Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin;
 
(ii)
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin;
 
(iii) Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share; and
 
(iv) Revenue growth on an organic constant currency basis.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, should not be considered a substitute
for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other
companies. Accordingly, the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from those financial statements should be
carefully evaluated. EXL believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures may help investors better understand EXL’s underlying financial
performance. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with EXL’s reported results, can provide
useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s results and comparisons of the Company’s
results with the results of other companies. Additionally, management considers some of these non-GAAP financial measures to determine variable
compensation of its employees. The Company believes that it is unreasonably difficult to provide its earnings per share financial guidance in
accordance with GAAP, or a qualitative reconciliation thereof, for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the Company’s inability to predict
its future stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718, the amortization of intangibles associated with further acquisitions and the
currency fluctuations and associated tax impacts. As such, the Company presents guidance with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share. The
Company also incurs significant non-cash charges for depreciation that may not be indicative of the Company’s ability to generate cash flow.
EXL non-GAAP financial measures exclude, where applicable, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets, provision for litigation settlement, impairment charges on acquired long-lived and intangible assets including goodwill, effects of termination of
leases, certain defined social security contributions, other acquisition-related expenses or benefits and effect of any non-recurring tax adjustments.
Acquisition-related expenses or benefits include, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, external deal costs, integration expenses, direct
and incremental travel costs and non-recurring benefits or losses. Our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS also excludes the effects of
income tax on the above pre-tax items, as applicable. The effects of income tax of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate of the local tax
regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred.
A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial
measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and exclude costs that are
recurring, namely stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. EXL compensates for these limitations by
providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such
non-GAAP financial measures.
The information provided on an organic constant currency basis reflects a comparison of current period results translated at the prior period currency
rates and exclude the impact from an acquisition for a twelve-month period from the date of the acquisition. This information is provided because EXL
believes that it provides useful comparative incremental information to investors regarding EXL’s true operating performance. EXL’s primary exchange
rate exposure is with the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the
Indian rupee increased from 75.25 during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 to 82.25 during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, representing a
depreciation of 9.3% against the U.S. dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso increased from 51.32 during the
quarter ended March 31, 2022 to 54.78 during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, representing a depreciation of 6.7% against the U.S. dollar. The
average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar decreased from 1.33 during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 to 1.23 during
the quarter ended March 31, 2023, representing a depreciation of 7.9% against the U.S. dollar.
The following table shows the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022,
and the three months ended December 31, 2022:

revenue to be in the range of $1.595 billion to $1.620 billion, up from our prior guidance of $1.560 billion to $1.600 billion. This represents 13% to 15%
year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We are also increasing our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for
2023 to $6.75 to $6.90, from $6.60 to $6.80, representing growth of 12% to 15% over the prior year.”

EXLSERVICE HOLDINGS, INC.
Reconciliation of Adjusted Financial Measures to GAAP Measures
In addition to its reported operating results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), EXL has included in this release
certain financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures, including the following:
 
(i)
Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin;
 
(ii)
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin;
 
(iii) Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share; and
 
(iv) Revenue growth on an organic constant currency basis.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, should not be considered a substitute
for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other
companies. Accordingly, the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from those financial statements should be
carefully evaluated. EXL believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures may help investors better understand EXL’s underlying financial
performance. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with EXL’s reported results, can provide
useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s results and comparisons of the Company’s
results with the results of other companies. Additionally, management considers some of these non-GAAP financial measures to determine variable
compensation of its employees. The Company believes that it is unreasonably difficult to provide its earnings per share financial guidance in
accordance with GAAP, or a qualitative reconciliation thereof, for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the Company’s inability to predict
its future stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718, the amortization of intangibles associated with further acquisitions and the
currency fluctuations and associated tax impacts. As such, the Company presents guidance with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share. The
Company also incurs significant non-cash charges for depreciation that may not be indicative of the Company’s ability to generate cash flow.
EXL non-GAAP financial measures exclude, where applicable, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets, provision for litigation settlement, impairment charges on acquired long-lived and intangible assets including goodwill, effects of termination of
leases, certain defined social security contributions, other acquisition-related expenses or benefits and effect of any non-recurring tax adjustments.
Acquisition-related expenses or benefits include, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, external deal costs, integration expenses, direct
and incremental travel costs and non-recurring benefits or losses. Our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS also excludes the effects of
income tax on the above pre-tax items, as applicable. The effects of income tax of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate of the local tax
regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred.
A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial
measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and exclude costs that are
recurring, namely stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. EXL compensates for these limitations by
providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such
non-GAAP financial measures.
The information provided on an organic constant currency basis reflects a comparison of current period results translated at the prior period currency
rates and exclude the impact from an acquisition for a twelve-month period from the date of the acquisition. This information is provided because EXL
believes that it provides useful comparative incremental information to investors regarding EXL’s true operating performance. EXL’s primary exchange
rate exposure is with the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the
Indian rupee increased from 75.25 during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 to 82.25 during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, representing a
depreciation of 9.3% against the U.S. dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso increased from 51.32 during the
quarter ended March 31, 2022 to 54.78 during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, representing a depreciation of 6.7% against the U.S. dollar. The
average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar decreased from 1.33 during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 to 1.23 during
the quarter ended March 31, 2023, representing a depreciation of 7.9% against the U.S. dollar.
The following table shows the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022,
and the three months ended December 31, 2022:
