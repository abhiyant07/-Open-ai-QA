Accordingly, the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from those financial statements should be\\ncarefully evaluated. EXL believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures may help investors better understand EXL’s underlying financial\\nperformance. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with EXL’s reported results, can provide\\nuseful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s results and comparisons of the Company’s\\nresults with the results of other companies. Additionally, management considers some of these non-GAAP financial measures to determine variable\\ncompensation of its employees. The Company believes that it is unreasonably difficult to provide its earnings per share financial guidance in\\naccordance with GAAP, or a qualitative reconciliation thereof, for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the Company’s inability to predict\\nits future stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718, the amortization of intangibles associated with further acquisitions and the\\ncurrency fluctuations and associated tax impacts. As such, the Company presents guidance with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share. The\\nCompany also incurs significant non-cash charges for depreciation that may not be indicative of the Company’s ability to generate cash flow.\\nEXL non-GAAP financial measures exclude, where applicable, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible\\nassets, provision for litigation settlement, impairment charges on acquired long-lived and intangible assets including goodwill, effects of termination of\\nleases, certain defined social security contributions, other acquisition-related expenses or benefits and effect of any non-recurring tax adjustments.\\nAcquisition-related expenses or benefits include, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, external deal costs, integration expenses, direct\\nand incremental travel costs and non-recurring benefits or losses. Our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS also excludes the effects of\\nincome tax on the above pre-tax items, as applicable. The effects of income tax of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate of the local tax\\nregulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred.\\nA limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial\\nmeasures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and exclude costs that are\\nrecurring, namely stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. EXL compensates for these limitations by\\nproviding specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such\\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\\nThe information provided on an organic constant currency basis reflects a comparison of current period results translated at the prior period currency\\nrates and exclude the impact from an acquisition for a twelve-month period from the date of the acquisition. This information is provided because EXL\\nbelieves that it provides useful comparative incremental information to investors regarding EXL’s true operating performance. EXL’s primary exchange\\nrate exposure is with the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the\\nIndian rupee increased from 75.25 during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 to 82.25 during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, representing a\\ndepreciation of 9.3% against the U.S. dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso increased from 51.32 during the\\nquarter ended March 31, 2022 to 54.78 during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, representing a depreciation of 6.7% against the U.S. dollar. The\\naverage exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar decreased from 1.33 during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 to 1.23 during\\nthe quarter ended March 31, 2023, representing a depreciation of 7.9% against the U.S. dollar.\\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022,\\nand the three months ended December 31, 2022:\\nReconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA\\n(Amounts in thousands)\\n \\n \\nThree months ended\\n \\n \\nMarch 31,\\n \\nDecember 31,\\n \\n  \\n2023\\n   \\n2022\\n   \\n2022\\n \\nNet Income (GAAP)\\n $\\n51,331  $\\n36,178  $\\n31,849 \\nadd: Income tax expense\\n  \\n8,058   \\n11,202   \\n12,791 \\nadd/(subtract): Foreign exchange gain/(loss), interest expense, effects of\\nequity-method investment and other income/(loss), net\\n  \\n59   \\n(3,405)   \\n6,355 \\nIncome from operations (GAAP)\\n $\\n59,448  $\\n43,975  $\\n50,995 \\nadd: Stock-based compensation expense\\n  \\n14,407   \\n11,224   \\n12,616 \\nadd: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles\\n  \\n4,149   \\n4,486   \\n4,234 \\nadd/(subtract): Other expenses/(benefits) (a)\\n  \\n(89)   \\n134   \\n(560)\\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP)\\n $\\n77,915 \\n $\\n59,819 \\n $\\n67,285 \\nAdjusted operating income margin as a % of Revenue (Non-GAAP)\\n  \\n19.4%   \\n18.2%   \\n18.0%\\nadd: Depreciation on long-lived assets\\n  \\n8,589   \\n9,116   \\n9,687 \\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\\n $\\n86,504  $\\n68,935  $\\n76,972 \\nAdjusted EBITDA margin as a % of revenue (Non-GAAP)\\n  \\n21.6%   \\n20.9%   \\n20.5%\\n(a) To exclude effects of lease termination of $89 and $nil during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, and $560 during the\\nthree months ended December 31, 2022, and to exclude acquisition-related expenses of $134 for the acquisition of Clairvoyant AI, Inc.
